Problem Statement:
This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.

Time for some fake graphics! Letâ€™s say we want to draw game boards that look like this:

 --- --- ---
|   |   |   |
 --- --- ---
|   |   |   |
 --- --- ---
|   |   |   |
 --- --- ---
